                        At The Gilded Fork, we're not just serving dinner, we're serving a statement—a statement that says, '<span class="italic">I have so much money, I can pay for an experience that is 99% plate and 1% sustenance.</span>'

                        Our chefs have scoured the globe for the most needlessly expensive ingredients, ensuring that every bite is a reminder of your superior social and financial standing.

                        For some meals, there is so much gold... so many diamonds... that what you are seeing is no more a meal to be enjoyed, but rather an ostentatious work of art to be photographed.

                        <br>

                        For some other meals, portions are inversely proportional to the price—the smaller your meal is, the greater the attention you gain.
